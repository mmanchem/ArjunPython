Machine Learning is of two types 

1. Supervised Learning
2. Unsupervised Learning


Supervised Learning   : if the target is dependent of independent variables or we can predicat outcome based on input variables
                         we called it as supervised learning
                      
       
Unsupervised Learning : if we dont know target and we will try to cluster input variable we called it as unsupervised learning


Supervised Learning is divided into two parts

1  Regression 
2  Classfication 

Regression : if the target is continues variable then problem fall under regression bucket

Classfication : if the target has dicrete data or catgeorical data we called it as Classfication

Algorithms we use in Regression are

1 simple linear regression

2 Multiple linear regression

3 Polynomial regression 

Advance Regressions Algorithams

Ridge resgression 
Lasso regression
Gradient decent regression 

above alogorithms we exculisvely use for regressions

there are othere regression which we use for both Classfication and regression
