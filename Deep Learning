Deep Learning :

it is next level of machine learning 

we have few drawbacks in machine learning 

overfitting and underfitting 

Machine learning algorithms doent iterate multiple times

we wont get optimized hyper parameters (coefficents or weigths)

To overcome drawbacks in Machine Learning we use deep learing concepts

Deep Learning concept is based on human neuron working 

it works like human learns from its mistakes and gives us optimized weights
