Deep Learning :

it is next level of machine learning 

we have few drawbacks in machine learning 

overfitting and underfitting 

Machine learning algorithms doent iterate multiple times

we wont get optimized hyper parameters (coefficents or weigths)

To overcome drawbacks in Machine Learning we use deep learing concepts

Deep Learning concept is based on human neuron working 

it works like human learns from its mistakes and gives us optimized weights 


we use 3 algorithams to solve our drawbacks in ML

ANN  -- Artificial Neural Network
CNN  -- Convolutional Neural Network
RNN  -- Recursive Neural Network

1.ANN:

ANN uses 3 layer architehture 

input  layer 
hidden layer 
output layer

we can apply both regression and classfication problems to ANN 

input layer contains input nodes and number of nodes is always number of indpendent variables

output layer conatins node which are equal to 1 when binary classfication and if we have more than two classficaions 

then nodes number is equal to number of classfications 

hidden layer nodes count=(input nodes+out put nodes)/2 --thumb rules most of the DS follows

we can add any number of hidden layer base on our requirement


we use activation functions to activate nodes 

we have activation functions like below

RELU
Threshold
Sigmoid
Hyperbolic Tang
softmax etc.

we use Keras package on top of Tensforflow or Theano 

cost function do backpropagation to reduce C value(penality)

CNN is extention of ANN which can process unstructred data 

it has below following layers

Convolution Layer --> read the unstructed data by image augumenation in matrix form and then pull pattern from
 origina data by using feature detector and which converts it to feature map

Pooling  --we use pooling to adjust the image in CNN to get in right position 

Flatting it is used convert matrix data to single list of data ..each feature map is on indpendent data column after flatting 

Fully Connected layers now we connect flatting output to ANN netwrok
