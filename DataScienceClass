Regression 

1)	Simple  linear regression
Y=b0+b1x1

Y=mx+c

Y=b0+b1x1+e
e is error

Y is target variable

B0 is interceptor
X1= independent variable or predictor 
B1 = coefficient  or slope 

B0 is like , when x axis 0 and and line the line touching  y – axis is called B0



 




Try to place the target variable in last column



Sckit learn has all MLM, DP ,NLP

SciPy is scientific python 

Scikit leran is  developed on top of ScipY





import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  visualization    
import pandas as pd
import scipy as sp

when dealing with regression model we need two matrixs

one x which has independent variable

Y  has target  matrixes

Model is excuted on Train set
And actual accuuate set

If we are dealing with single independent varai ble
Always you need to consider   R squared values


If we are dealing with multiple independent variable
Always consider adjusted R square value

lm(formula = Salary ~ YearsExperience, data = training_set)

 To run multiple linear regression :
Distribution :

What is meant  by Normal Distribution

Probability of given set of values are called distribution or Normal distribution
Which is bell curve or T curve or Gaussian distribution?

Distribution is of 2 types:
Uniform or discrete uniform distribution 
Normal 
Normal distribution contains categorical and continuous distribution
Regression lines are defined on co efficient or slopes in multiple regression 	
Co efficient probability values are defined by distribution


Example for  uniform distribution is throwimg a dice and getting outputs
1	1/6
2	 1/6
3	1/6
4	1/6
5	1/6
6	1/6
Normal Distribution:

When we throw 2 dices the probabilities of outcome is example of Normal distribution

Minimum 2 
2=(1,1)


In statically Normal distribution is also called as Z score
Z –score=X-U(MU)/SIGMAE
X = Indpenendent variable
U= mean
Sigma is standard deviation
N  ~(distribution)(mu,sigma or(sigma squure which is variance))
N~(0,1) 0,1 are default values
Mean =0
SD=1 
P –Value
Probability value varies from range from 0 to 1


Techniquues in multiple linear regression 


1)	All in
2)	 Backward elimination
3)	Forward selection
4)	Bi directional elimination(95% of people use this)
5)	Score comparison
1 ) ALL IN
    Y=b0+b1x1+b2x2+b3x3
If we include all indiependenant in LR it is called ALL IN

2)	Back ward Elimination
                              Y=b0+b1x1+b2x2+b3x3
After ist iteration                                Y=b0+b1x1+b2x2
                                 Y=b0+b1x1+b2x2
        After nd iteration                          Y=b0+b1x1

3)forword
             Y=b0+b1x1
             Y=b0+b1x1+b2x2
               Y=b0+b1x1+b2x2+b3x3
r
4)score compariomn


Signinficane error
Standard significant level is 0.05 
5/100=0.05
Out of 100 threshold is 5 which means 5 are defect
Standard significant level in statistics
