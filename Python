1) Python Features 
  type inference --> no neeed to define object data type like int ,float it will automatically inference data type
  code once run any where --> we can execute .py extension file anywhere like linuix,windows,mac etc after it is successfully executed 
  embedded --> we can embedded python code any C or java 
  extensable ---> we can include other languages in Python 
  
 2) difference between 2.x and 3.x
   print is now function in 3.x
   we dont have data type long in 3.x
   we have only input method to read standard i/o from keyboard it is input() 
   
   
  3) Python  data Types 
     core python has many data types which are mutable and immutable type
     immutable (once defined can not  be modified it values during program execution)
     int --> example :- 1,-1, 56 etc. there is no limit for int data type in python 3.x
     float --> real floating values like 0.344,9.89 etc
     string --> string data type which are enclose in quotes ('HI', "HI",'''HI''')
     character -->
     bool--       bool holds two values True or False intrernally it is represented by 1 and 0 respectively 
     complex-->   (a+bj) where b is imaginary part and a is real part
     tuple -->    tuple is a collection data structures which holds more than one value of same or differnet data type
                  a tuple can have  any core python data type as its value like list,dict,tuple ,str ,sets etc..
     set -->       set is also a collection data structure and holds only unique values and un order data set 
                   set is replica of mathematical set operation hence it works like maths set functions
                   syntax a={1,3,4,5} ,to create empty set use in build function set constructer 
                   x=set()
     mutable      (we can alter values in this data  stucture during program execution )
     ----------
     list -->        list is collection data type which holds multiple data types of any core python data structure 
                     l=[1,2,3,[888],(1,2),'hi']
     dictionary-->   dictionary is a key : value base data structure of unorder set 
                     key is should be unique in a dictionary
     boolarry-->     it is a 256 byte array
