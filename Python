1) Python Features 
  type inference --> no neeed to define object data type like int ,float it will automatically inference data type
  code once run any where --> we can execute .py extension file anywhere like linuix,windows,mac etc after it is successfully executed 
  embedded --> we can embedded python code any C or java 
  extensable ---> we can include other languages in Python 
  
 2) difference between 2.x and 3.x
   print is now function in 3.x
   we dont have data type long in 3.x
   we have only input method to read standard i/o from keyboard it is input() 
   
   
  3) Python  data Types 
     core python has many data types which are mutable and immutable type
     immutable 
     int
     float
     string 
     bool
     comples (a+bj) where b is imaginary part and a is real part
     tuple
     set
     mutable
     list
     dictionary 
     boolarry
